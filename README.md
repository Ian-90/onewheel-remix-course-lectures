# Remix Onewheel Course Lecture Breakdown

While going through the Remix course from [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/remix-intro-up-and-running-with-remix), I found it difficult to follow along with code changes each lecture.

I broke the code changes into lectures so that it would be easier to follow.

Each lecture has an associated Diff Store link that shows you the changes and lets you download the code as shown at the beginning or end of any of the lectures.

Here they are:

1. Intro: Up and Running with Remix (no code changes)
2. Create a New Remix Project Using the remix-create CLI
   - Run `npx create-remix --template remix-run/indie-stack .`
   - Say "Yes"
   - Keep "TypeScript"
   - Run `npm run dev` to start
